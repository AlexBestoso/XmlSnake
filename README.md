# XmlSnake
A class for creating and parsing xml files in c/c++

Run `make install` to install the dependancies.

If you still have issues compiling the xml stuff, you may need to make a symlink to correct the problem. This can be done with the following commands:

`cd /usr/include`
`sudo ln -s /usr/include/libxml2/libxml/ ./libxml`
